# Tracking-Via-Motion
Small project in Matlab that can track moving objects relatively well. It takes your webcam feed as an input and then finds the difference in intensity of the current frame and the previous frame. This method sometimes results in only the edges of objects being visible, so it then attempts to automatically fill in more of the moving object. This end result is converted to a binary representation, on which I use Matlab's blob analysis to predict where any moving objects might be. My binary representation isn't as good as I'd like it to be yet, so I plan on optimizing it more, as well as maybe making it more interactive (for example using it to let you draw on the screen). You can see what it looks like in action on my website.
